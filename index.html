        <h3>Setup:</h3>
        <p>
          The game is designed for 2 to 4 players, from 12 years old and more
        </p>
        <p>A game lasts about 20 minutes</p>
        <p>
          Shuffle the "property" cards, deal them 1 by 1 (10 for each player),
          those cards are set inline in front of the players
        </p>
        <p>
          Shuffle the "value" cards and special cards, deal them 1 by 1 (5 for
          each player)
        </p>
        <p>Each player should always have 5 cards in their hand</p>
        <p>The youngest player starts, then play proceeds clockwise.</p>
        <h3>Rules:</h3>
        <p>Each turn, the player has 3 options:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Place an appropriate value on their own property cards</li>
          <li>
            Place an inappropriate value on their opponents' property cards to
            create a 'bug'
          </li>
          <li>
            Fix a bug on one of their own property cards by discarding the bad
            value and replacing it with good value
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If a player plays a "senior dev" card, he/she can fix 1 to 3 bugs on
          his/her board at the same time by putting a "fix" token on the
          inapropriate values on their board
        </p>
        <p>
          If a player plays a "junior dev" card, he/she can put 1 to 3 cards in
          his/her hand on 1, 2 or 3 opponents to put "bugs" on their board
        </p>
        <p>
          First player to complete his/her stylesheet without any bug wins the
          game
        </p>
